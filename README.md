Automating the Process of Searching for Jobs using the Selenium Open-Source API through 4 Major Job Sites (Indeed, Glassdoor, Linkedin, IrishJobs)

Due to recent (COVID-19) pandemic, it has proved a great challenge to secure a job directly after graduating this year. I intended to give myself a few weeks to enjoy my summer after a taxing 4 years studying 'Robotics and Intelligent Devices' which paid off after I received a Bachelor of Science (BSc) 'First Class Honours'. As a result, I decided to improve upon my skills and knowledge by automating the job searching and application process. This project current gives anyone the ability to search for job position in a location of their choice on the 4 job platforms named above. I intend to schedule the program to run every morning via the 'Windows Task Scheduler Application' to improve my chances of landing my dream job.
